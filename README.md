- [Backend Developer Name- Aayush Gautam]


## 1. Concept

**OptiForce** is a unified, AI-powered **Workforce Intelligence Platform** that:

- Monitors employee productivity, engagement, and availability.
- Recommends optimal staffing (internal employees or new hires) for projects.
- Optimizes project costs, timelines, and resource allocation.

The platform leverages AI models wherever required for performance calculation, predictive staffing, and cost optimization.

## 2. Core Problem

Companies face challenges such as:

- **Underutilized talent:** Good employees remain idle while new hires are recruited.  
- **Poor visibility:** Managers cannot accurately assess workloads or engagement.  
- **Cost inefficiency:** Hidden losses from hiring, overtime, and delays.  
- **Unclear staffing decisions:** Lack of data-driven assignment of employees to projects.  

---

## 3. Solution Overview

OptiForce integrates **Employee Monitoring**, **Project Staffing Recommendation**, and **Cost Optimization** into one intelligent platform.

### Core Components

| Module                           | Function                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Monitor**          | Tracks productivity, deadlines, work hours, and engagement.             |
| **Skill & Role Profiler**        | Maps employees’ skills, experience, and project history.               |
| **Project Matcher**              | Recommends employees for projects based on skill, availability, and cost. |
| **Cost Optimizer (COS Engine)**  | Suggests the most cost-effective team while maintaining project quality.|
| **Predictive Workforce Planner** | Forecasts staffing gaps and recommends internal transfers or hires.    |

## 4. System Workflow

**Step 1: Continuous Monitoring**  
Track employee task completion, hours, overtime, idle time, and engagement trends.

**Step 2: Skill & Workload Profiling**  
AI builds live profiles including skill score, productivity trend, availability percentage, and cost per hour.

**Step 3: New Project Requirement**  
Manager inputs project name, required skills, budget, and timeline.

**Step 4: AI Recommendation**  
- Identifies internal employees matching skill, availability, and cost constraints.  
- Suggests external hires if no internal match exists.  

**Step 5: Cost Optimization**  
COS Engine simulates multiple staffing options and recommends the most efficient team composition.

## 5. Example Use Case

**Scenario:** Project “Orion” requires 2 frontend developers and 1 project manager.

**OptiForce Output:**  
- 2 internal employees identified with 90% skill match and low workload.  
- 1 overloaded PM detected → recommends 1 external PM (85% fit, $60/hr).  
- Optimized team:  
> “Use Alice & Rohan internally; hire John externally — 28% cost reduction, 92% skill coverage.”
